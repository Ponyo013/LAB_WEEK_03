    <string name="americano_title">AMERICANO</string>
    <string name="americano_desc">Espresso with added hot water (100-150 ml).
        Often served in a cappuccino cup. (The espresso is added into the hot water rather than
        all the water being flowed through the coffee that would lead to over extraction.)</string>
    <string name="latte_title">CAFFE LATTE</string>
    <string name="latte_desc">A tall, mild \'milk coffee\' (about 150-300 ml). An
        espresso with steamed milk and only a little milk foam poured over it. Serve in a
        latte glass or a coffee cup. Flavored syrup can be added.</string>
    <string name="matcha_title">MATCHA LATTE</string>
    <string name="matcha_desc">A smooth and creamy drink made with finely ground Japanese green tea powder
        (matcha) whisked with hot water, then blended with steamed milk. It has a vibrant green color, a slightly grassy and earthy taste,
        and a gentle natural sweetness. Often enjoyed with latte art or a dusting of matcha on top.</string>
    <string name="long_title">LONG BLACK</string>
    <string name="long_desc">An espresso-based coffee drink made by pouring a shot (or double shot) of espresso over hot water.
        This method preserves the crema (the golden foam on top of espresso), giving it a strong, bold flavor but slightly less intensity
        than a straight espresso. Common in Australia and New Zealand.</string>
